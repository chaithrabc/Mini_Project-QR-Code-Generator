# **QR Code Generator**

This Python script serves as a convenient tool to generate QR codes, those distinctive square patterns widely used for swiftly accessing websites or information through your mobile device. Let's walk through the steps to utilize this functionality seamlessly:

## **Execution Steps**

1. **Install Python:** If Python isn't already installed on your system, please ensure to install it first. You can effortlessly do so by visiting Python's official website https://www.python.org/and following the provided instructions.

2. **Install the `qrcode` Library:** Next, in your terminal or command prompt, execute `pip install qrcode[pil]` to install the essential `qrcode` library required for generating QR codes.

3. **Run the Script:** With the prerequisites in place, navigate to the directory containing the script via your terminal or command prompt. Then, simply enter `python qr_code_generator.py` and press enter to execute the script.

Upon execution, a QR code representing the default website `https://example.com` will promptly appear on your screen. However, if you wish to customize this URL or the file name, fret not; the process is straightforward (details provided below). Additionally, the script automatically saves the generated QR code as an image file named `example_qr_code.png`.
Feel free to tailor the website URL and file name of the QR code to your preference. Open the script in any text editor, locate the `url` and `file_name` variables, and adjust them accordingly. Any modifications you make will be reflected in the generated QR code.
